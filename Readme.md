# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to explore the relationship of taste in music and choice of video games. By considering song metadata and data from video game sales, we can get an idea of this relationship. My project is a recommendation engine that takes in a song or artist, and produces the video game with the highest similarity score. This score is calculated based on key features extracted from the datasets I used: year, emotional mappings, genre, and 1 more to be inserted later. To achieve this, I used multiple python libraries. I used pandas to manipulate the datasets, sklearn for normalization of data and creation/training of the machine learning models, matplotlib for creating visualizations of the data, and numpy for arithmetic manipulation of the data. For the UI, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the UI and add functionality. The data used in this project is the Audio Features from songs 1911-2011, Spotify Track Features, and video game sales trends, all available on Kaggle.
